you were pregnant.

we thought, "They're nuts!"

But they were attracting
the best possible people,

create the best product,

00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,017
Sorry. Excuse me, Jack.

357
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,936
Are you leaving?

358
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,488
Oh, I have this charity wine thing.

359
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,524
Sorry, I committed to it months ago,

360
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,526

it in there, Richard.

361
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,578
Uh, well, actually no.

362
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:43,330
Sorry. They just said

363
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,200
that you told them that we
would be business-facing?

364
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,502
Ah, they filled you in. That's good.

365
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,505
I was under the impression that
we would be consumer first.

366
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,041
My guys are pretty set on that.

367
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,961
Richard, I read your deck,

368
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,297
and you projected it'll be four
years until we get to revenue?

369
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,349
Uh, yeah.

370
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,135
You know we're in a
bubble right now, right?

371
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,888
Or maybe you don't know. You weren't
around for the last bubble.

372
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,857
You were probably in diapers.

373
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,142
- I was 11.
- Well, I wasn't in diapers.

374
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,111
I don't... I wasn't either.

375
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:15,613
I was there.

376
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:19,366
And in March of 2000, do you know
when a four-year plan ended?

377
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,620
April of 2000.

378
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:24,955
We gotta move, now.

of-the-rainbow basket.

381
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:34,048
So, the... the pot of
gold is in the basket?

382
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:38,419
Richard, these are the best
salespeople in the world,

383
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,055
and when they tell me that
business-facing is the play,

384
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,556
I gotta listen to that, okay?

385
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,009
- That's fair, but it's...
- I'm just asking you

386
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,310
to talk to your guys

387
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,979
about modifying your
platform for enterprise.

388
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:52,066
I mean, just... just see
how it feels, okay?

389
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,601
And no matter what happens,

390
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,935
I promise you this:

391
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,154
I will never compromise the product.

392
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,939
Okay. Okay.

393
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,774
Fine, I will talk to my guys,

394
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,193
but they're not gonna be happy about it.

395
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,945
No, of course not. They're engineers.

396
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,447
I'll see you later.

397
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,918
I realize this is a Japanese
tradition and that you are Chinese.

398
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,753
I'm not racist.

399
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,205
Yes, Japanese people racist.

400
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,676
- They are horrible.
- No. No, no.

401
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,545
Jian-Yang, in every relationship,

402
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,548
there are ebbs and flows.

403
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:26,800
- Ebbs?
- Yes.

404
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,385
And although we have flowed,

405
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:29,887
our relationship now

406
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:32,523
has come to a permanent ebbing.

407
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,391
- Flow.
- No.

408
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,026
No.

409
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,396
We have come to a permanent ebb.

410

Do you understand?

411
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,618
So, you want me to leave the house?

412
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,204
Yes. Yes. Very much so.

413
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,574
And so, I thank you...

414
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,543
for our today.

415
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,165
Now you bow.

416
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,052
Bow.

And in reality, you're just a minority.

440

Richard, relax. We're still
building the neural net.

441

We still get to do all
the cool stuff, right?

Yeah, of course.

No, no, definitely not.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

447
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,626
Well, the eviction process
is officially underway,

448
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,829
but my attorney says it
may take up to a year.

- Well, I always have my trick.

Look, once we get enough data
flowing through the system,

530
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,010
it will be able to recognize
long-range patterns

531
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:54,544
and actually learn.

532
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,714
It will be able to optimize
our algorithm on its own,

533
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,801
increasing our already
superior speed and efficiency.

534
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,136
Right? Pretty cool, huh?

535
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,856
But it won't be able to
do that if we delete it.

536
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,724
- Do you get that?
- But you just said it.

537
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,360
It requires a central
repository of data, right?

538
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,728
Businesses want to protect their data.

539
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,563
They're huge pussies when
it comes to security.

540
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,532
Okay, well, we're not cutting
machine learning. We're not.

541
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:18,068
If we cut that, we might as
well cut peer-to-peer delivery,

542
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:19,987
and all the efficiencies of the cloud.

543
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,822
Are those still in?

544
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,323
No, those have to go also.

545
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,791
- What?
- Keith, by the way.

546
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,710
I know your name, okay? I
know everybody's name.

547
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:28,078
Look... (chuckles)

548
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:30,247
we can't cut everything
about this platform

549
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,882
that makes it revolutionary
just because that's

550
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,633
a little harder for you
guys to sell, all right?

551
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,420
If we want to sell out, let's
just sell all the way out.

552
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,840
Let's just take the algorithm,
jam it into a metal fucking box,

553
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,725
stick it in the back of a
data center somewhere,

554
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,143
so it can't connect to anything,

555
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,595
and it just sits there and no
one even knows it's there.

556
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:49,516
Doug, still shadowing Keith.

557
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,068
When you say "metal box," you're talking

558
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,903
about a rack-mounted
server-type appliance?

559
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:56,440
No, no, no. I am using it
as a rhetorical example

560
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,158
of a bad idea.

561
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,110
That's fucking stupid.

562
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,328
Oh my God.

563
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,080
I just need to find Jack. One second.

564
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,667
- Where's Jack?
- He had to go meet his vet.

565
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,587
His vet? In the middle of the day?

566
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:12,456
Okay, well, what's the vet's address?

567
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:16,960
♪ ♪

568
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,464
Jack, excuse me. Do you
mind telling me...

569
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,766
Holy shit. What is that?

570
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:25,352
- Oh, mother of God.
- Richard, what are you doing here?

571
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,971
What do you mean? It's 2:30.
What are you doing here?

572
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:30,307
My number one breeding
mare went into heat.

573
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,359
Sorry, she's not much for schedules.

574
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,310
Oh God.

575
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,312
Thoroughbreds, Richard.

576
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,980
Natural cover only.

577
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,282
Now, you don't see that
very often, do you?

578
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:40,984
Nope. Uh...

579
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,702
I had a meeting...

580
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,621
I had a meeting with the sales guys

581
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:46,573
and Jan the Man...

582
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,657
(stammers)

583
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,326
You know what? Can we talk over here?

584
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,161
This is just hard for me.

585
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,163
(horse grunting)

586
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,387
Look, Jack, you and I have a problem.

587
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,222
Okay, your salespeople are telling me

588
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,840
to cut everything cool
about the platform

589
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:06,426
just because it's a little
bit harder for them to sell.

590
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:10,814
But don't you think because they
are such amazing salespeople

591
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:15,602
that it would be okay for them
to sell the harder stuff?

592
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,021
No. It doesn't work that way.

593
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,240
The way you keep the
best salespeople is,

594
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,526
you need to give 'em
something easy to sell.

595
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,007
(scoffs)

596
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:24,218
Otherwise, they'd just
go somewhere else.

597
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,864
Okay, well, Pied Piper could
honestly be the global standard

598
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,282
for file compression and storage.

599
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,952
Every mobile device on
the face of the planet

600
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,037
could be able to access their data

601
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,456
as if they had a fiber optic
cable plugged into it.

602
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,292
People in the desert,
people in refugee camps,

603
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,762
people who have nothing could
suddenly have access to everything.

604
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,881
You know, everybody in this industry,

605
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,551
they say they want to make
this world a better place,

606
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,219
but we could actually do it.

607
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,888
We could do it and make
billions of dollars.

608
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:54,558
- Richard, listen...
- No, you listen to me, Jack.

609
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:58,111
You promised me that you would
never compromise the product.

610
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,448
So, do you feel like taking some
action and backing me up on this,

611
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,732
because me and my product

612
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,534
feel pretty fucking
compromised right now.

613
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,238
Richard, I don't think you
understand what the product is.

614
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,073
The product isn't the platform,

615
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,742
and the product isn't
your algorithm, either.

616
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,544
And it's not even the software.

617
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,547
Do you know what Pied Piper's
product is, Richard?

618
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,717
Is...

619
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,136
Is it me?

620
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,172
Oh God! No!

621
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,507
No. How could it possibly be you?

622
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,892
You got fired.

623
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:31,595
Pied Piper's product is its stock.

624
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,230
Its stock?

625
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:35,849
And whatever makes the
value of that stock go up,

626
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,934
that is what we are going to make.

627
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,603
And maybe sometime in the future,

628
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,022
we could change the world
and perform miracles,

629
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,608
and all of that stuff, and I hope we do.

630
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:45,825
But, like I told you before,

631
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,861
I'm not going to mortgage
the present for that.

632
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,996
I need to move the needle today.

633
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,781
And now, if you will excuse me.

634
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,783
I paid $150,000

635
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,286
for the semen that's about to
come out of that stallion,

636
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,673
and I would very much like to be
there to see that it happens.

637
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,174
- (cell phone chimes)
- (horse neighing)

638
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,093
Oh! Hey, Richard!

639
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,220
Yes?

640
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:07,371
I just got a text from
Keith, Northeast Regional.

641
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,883
He says the guys love your idea.

642
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,017
What idea?

643
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,103
- ♪
♪
- Announcer: It's a big world,

644
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,222
but thanks to modern technology,

645
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,473
it's smaller than ever.

646
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,025
Today, business moves
at the speed of light.

647
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,646
You can access your company's
data anywhere, anytime.

648
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,564
But if you can get your data,

649
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,483
who else can get it?

650
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:31,037
Spies, thieves, criminals,
and foreigners.

651
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,906
What if there was a way

652
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,658
to take all of your company's data

653
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,793
and back it up in a protected enclosure

654
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:39,496
completely isolated from
the world at large?

655
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,830
Oh no.

656
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,334
The ultimate enterprise
data storage solution.

657
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,510
Now that's what I'm talking about.

658
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:55,512
This is the game we're playing, team,

659
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,180
so let's win it!

660
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,819
You guys, check it out.

661
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:04,654
Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon

662
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,573
and filled it with watermelon jello!

663
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,908
Look, that's actual rind.

664
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,361
- The fuck is that?
- Is that a VCR?

665
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,697
Why does it say "Pied Piper" on it?

666
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,448
Why is everybody so happy?
