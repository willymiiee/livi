00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:09,847
I just got fired.

2
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:15,737
And what about me?

3
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,774
What about you?

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,025
What about me?

5
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:24,195
Okay. That's it.

6
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:26,201
I'm going over there right fucking now,

7
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:27,236
before they leave.

8
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:29,204
Erlich, I'm gonna use your car.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,146
Jared, you call Ron LaFlamme,
tell him to meet me there.

10
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:33,385
Fuck these assholes!

11
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:36,138
Wait. Richard, I'm coming with you.

12
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:38,023
Here. Jared, clear this.

13
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:39,057
Get all the smoke out of it.

14
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:41,109
- Otherwise, it damages the device.
- Umm...

15
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:42,311
Don't be a pussy.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,483
RICHARD: How could they do this?

17
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:49,368
How could they fire me
from my own company?

18
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:51,069
ERLICH: Just stay calm.
We're gonna fight this.

19
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:52,654
Jesus, Richard, slow down.

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,156
Stop, stop, stop!

21
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,662
Did I just hit a deer?

22
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:01,964
No, goddamn it!

23
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:03,749
Fucking Stanford Robotics.

24
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,834
Shit. Is this gonna make us late?

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,337
Oh! They killed the Bam-bot.

26
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:09,388
Fuck your Bam-bot!

27
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:11,924
You little Stanford cunts
fucked up my grille!

28
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,478
- Fucking piece of shit!
- Wait.

29
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:17,763
You little cunt!

30
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:19,898
- Fuck!
- RICHARD: Hey.

31
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,233
This one's for your mama.

32
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:23,519
Erlich, stop. Come on. Erlich,
we've got to get to Raviga.

33
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,187
Hey, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

RON: I'd bail on spin class
any day for you, Richie.

Richard. Richard.

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,256
I kept calling, you weren't answering.

40
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,958
Talk to the hand, Monica.

41
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:48,343
Richard, can you stop?
I can explain, okay?

42
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:52,130
It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica.
You voted to fire me.

43
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:54,016
What the fuck?

44
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:58,303
I mean, there is no way I'm
letting you push me out of this.

45
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,188
Our intention is not to push you out.

46
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:01,890
We wish rather to transition you

47
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:03,775
to a more appropriate
role within the company.

48
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:06,812
A new CEO will be brought in to
manage day-to-day operations

49
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:11,400
while you assume the role of
Chief Technology Officer.

50
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:13,118
Congratulations.

51
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:14,786
CTO? Yes.

52
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:18,574
You want me to be an
employee at my own company?

53
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,742
You would still be in
charge of the engineering,

54
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:23,962
and you'd continue vesting your
shares, and keep your board seat.

55
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:28,166
The same seat I had an hour ago
when you voted to fire me as CEO?

56
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,419
- That came in handy.
- Richard, please.

57
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:34,089
I realize this may be bittersweet,
but earlier this evening

58
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:37,509
Raviga decided to officially
fund Pied Piper Series A Round

59
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:40,429
at $5 million at a $50
million valuation.

60
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:44,566
Essentially, you have created a company
that is too valuable for you to run.

61
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:45,651
You should feel good about that.

62
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,269
Are you kidding me? I
made the company, okay?

63
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:49,938
I'm the one who came up
with the name "Pied Piper."

64
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:51,607
Yeah.

65
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:54,409
Ron, can I have a word please?

66
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,949
They can't really do this, can they?

67
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,118
I think they just did.

68
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:05,921
You remember that shit deal
you brought me from Hanneman,

69
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,256
and I said, "Hey, Richie,
this is a shit deal,"

70
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:09,708
but you took it anyway

71
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:12,544
because you wanted to do something
crazy for once in your life?

72
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,046
Yes, I remember.

73
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:16,965
Well, you basically just loaded a
gun and handed it to Hanneman,

74
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:19,267
and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga,

75
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:21,803
and then Raviga just fucking
pistol-whipped you.

76
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,224
But hey, at least they're letting you
keep your shares and your board seat.

77
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,893
You lose a little blood
with the dilution

78
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,729
for the new CEO, but I've seen worse.

79
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:32,864
Like that shit deal you
brought me from Hanneman.

80
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:34,366
(CHUCKLES)

81
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,985
If we give Richard a
little bit of space,

82
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,705
he'll be able to wrap
his head around this,

83
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:42,324
and a smooth transition to a
new CEO will be possible.

84
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,627
To wit, I served as the CEO of Aviat...

85
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:47,629
Mr. Bachman.

86
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:51,166
In the version of Pied Piper
in which I am invested,

87
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:55,003
you will not be CEO. Not now. Not ever.

88
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:59,591
Well, you, madam, are a
shrew of the first order.

89
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:02,010
Okay. I'm not gonna let you do this.

90
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,011
I'm gonna fight it.

91
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,513
I understand you're upset.

92
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,350
As you can see, this is a very
emotional time for me as well,

93
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:10,686
but we have some very strong candidates

94
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:12,237
coming in for the CEO position,

95
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:14,523
and we would so appreciate your input.

96
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,324
- My input?
- Mmm.

97
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,078
You want me to help you
pick my new replacement?

98
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:21,913
I'd rather quit.

99
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:23,832
And I don't care how much money I lose,

100
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:25,667
because I am gonna get it all back

101
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:29,004
when I sue the living shit out of you!

102
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,209
Okay. All right. All right.

103
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,878
Ron, let's go.

104
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:39,131
Sorry, I'm forced to inform you

105
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:42,467
that I can no longer provide
you with legal counsel.

106
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:45,470
What are you talking about?
You're my attorney.

107
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:50,108
No. Technically, I'm Pied
Piper's corporate counsel,

108
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:52,728
and you just declared
your intention to walk.

109
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:57,232
So, in effect, you kind of
just threatened to sue me,

110
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:00,235
and I don't take kindly to threats, Mr.
Hendricks.

111
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,070
"Mr. Hendricks"?

112
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:04,489
What happened to "Richie"?

113
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,875
Unfortunately, I'm not at
liberty to discuss him

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,210

didn't vote to remove you,

117
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:14,983
then Laurie would've
adjourned the meeting,

118
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:17,252
replaced my seat on the board
with someone else at Raviga,

119
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:19,137
and then they would've
voted to remove you.

At least this way, I'm
still in the game.

way, you kept your job.

Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO.

Look, I know I made some mistakes.
I wasn't perfect,

but I'll get better. I'll even
go to one of those CEO coaches,

What? Already?

138
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,930
You said that you didn't want to
be part of the interview process,

139
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,715
so they picked someone this morning.

140
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,019
Jack Barker. He's an incredibly
skilled, top-notch CEO.

I don't care who he is, okay?
None of us do.

Seriously? They picked that
gray-haired fossil over me?

145
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:20,198
You said you turned the job down.

146
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,484
I said it was mutual.

00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:23,568
Oh.

148
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:25,070
What? That's accurate.

149
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:26,955
He ran Entercross Systems.

150
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,492
They IPO'ed in 1998 for more
than a billion dollars.

151
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,494
Yeah, 20 fucking years ago.

152
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,329
Tech 1.0. What has he done lately?

153
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,998
After that, he ran
Turnwire for four years

154
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:40,669
until it was acquired by
Microsoft for $2 billion.

155
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,921
Holy shit. This guy's a hitter.

156
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:46,007
He was, in the oughts. What's
he done in the 20-teens?

157
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:48,426
Looks like he started a foundation

158
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,595
in his mother's name to cure cancer.

159
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,347
Yeah, how's that going? (SCOFFS)

160
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:54,316
Yeah. I bet his mother's dead.

161
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:57,686
Yeah, that's probably why
he started the foundation.

Richard, Laurie's meeting
with him tomorrow.

00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:01,573
You should come in and talk with him.

00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,191
No fucking way.

165
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,860
Think this through. I
mean, you have to know

166
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,945
that you can't start another
compression company.

167
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,415
No VC will fund that out
of fear of being sued,

No, I'm saying that...

Okay. Well, then I guess I'm fucked,

So, by our account,

330
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:59,321
just under 50 percent of
Hooli employment agreements

331
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,189
include a non-compete clause.

332
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:05,327
The same clause that caused us to lose
the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration

333
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:06,611
and are thus legally invalid,

334
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,498
calling into question
some of our IP ownership.

335
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,167
Shit. I was afraid of that.

336
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,954
But hypothetically, this also
presents an opportunity.

337
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,007
Any of those people could be
dismissed with no severance.

338
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,125
Any unvested stock

339
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,843

340
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:26,131
So, in other words, we have the right
to terminate any of those people

341
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,600
with no repercussions whatsoever,

342
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:30,936
and we'd actually make money?

343
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,804
Correct.

344
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,141
You know, our annual
individual performance reviews

345
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:40,228

- Yeah.

All right. Well, Jared...

358
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,064
we gotta one day figure out what
we're gonna do for you for a job.

359
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,900
Richard, you'll go. You'll
establish yourself,

360
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,486

right, you'll send for me.

362
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,324
Who, Barker? Pass.

363
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,993
This guy is real, okay, Richard?

364
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,528
With his managerial skills

365
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,196
and your talent as an engineer,

366
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,532
we could be talking
about the D-word here.

367
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:35,450
- Dick?
- No. Decacorn.

368
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:40,338
A company that's valued over $10 billion
before its initial public offering.

369
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:41,289
All right?

370
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,874
He's still at Raviga for another hour.

371
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,259
Please go talk to him.

372
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,796
Sorry, I can't do that. I'm
already set up at Flutterbeam.

373
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,765
Whose CEO, unprompted, said,

374
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:54,719
"A brain like Richard's comes
along once in a generation."

375
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,974
Sorry. I'm just proud.

376
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,310
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,946
Richard, I'm not asking
you to spoon with the guy

378
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,064
or even fork him.

379
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,233
- What I'm asking for...
- What is that?

380
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:11,069
Forking is when you use
your dick and your two legs

381
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,404
to stab him in the lower torso.

382
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,789
I'm asking for you to take
10 minutes and talk to him

383
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,958
before you throw everything
that we built away.

384
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,960
And yes, I did say "we."

385
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,212
I mean, if you want to stop by Raviga,

386
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:23,081
it's on the way to Flutterbeam.

387
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,219
I mean, I threw some Tyson-level
haymakers at this guy.

388
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:30,221
Richard, he didn't flinch.

389
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:32,257
He floats like a butterfly.

392
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,929

- Yep. Well aware.
- ...but...

00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,266

I'm sorry. Wow.

405
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,143
Well, it's just that you really think

that you're gonna be able to
scale the platform without me?

Goddamn it!

408
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:14,922
- Yeah.
- You don't think we can?

409
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,030
Well, I know you can't.

410
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:17,237
That's a bold statement.

411
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,987
- Richard.
- We have massive tech debt.

412
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,457
You really think that you can
scale and deploy my library

413
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,409
without any input from me?

414
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:26,494
Are you serious here?

415
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,628
- Yes, we do.
- Yeah.

416
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,498
Then I guess you are truly delusional.

I'm the arrogant prick.

419
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,170
Okay. This is coming from two people

420
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,506
who think they know everything
about code they didn't even write.

421
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,341
We wrote a lot of the code.

422
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,843
- You wrote some of it.
- You know what? We're gonna stay,

423
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,563
and we're gonna build Pied
Piper just to prove you wrong.

424
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,181

solidarity by the way,

You know what, Erlich?

427
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,151
You can tell Barker to go fuck himself,

428
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,520
so I can go to Flutterbeam

429
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,606

assholes crash and burn

we take the high road

00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,061
Yeah.

us at his new company.

547
00:22:48,824 --> 00:22:50,741
- Mustaches?
- Yes.

548
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,410
Doesn't necessarily
have to stop at people.

549
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:55,329
They can put mustaches
on their pets, too.

550
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:56,780
It's actually pretty fun.

551
00:22:56,916 --> 00:23:01,285
So, soon you'll be putting
mustaches on cats and dogs and...

552
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,287
- snakes.
- Snakes, yeah, yeah.

553
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:06,040
I mean, it's a little tricky because
they don't have a philtrum,

554
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:10,544
so finding an anchor point for
that mustache is actually...

555
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,764
gonna be quite of a
technological challenge.

556
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:15,466

Let me ask you something.

559
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,221
Why are you leaving Pied Piper?

560
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:25,893
They pushed me out.

561
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:27,444
I thought they offered
you another position.

562
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,813
Yeah, CTO. It's a demotion.

563
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:32,232
Well, wouldn't you be
CTO at Flutterbeam?

564
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:35,986
Yes, but at least this way,
I don't have to eat shit.

565
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:39,573
Richard, let me tell you something
I learned here on the inside.

566
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:45,913
Swallow your pride, or soon you'll be
eating something far worse than shit.

567
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,716
Believe me.

568

You take that severance package,

and you leave Hooli immediately.

581

But the most important aspect

582
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:39,717
is the non-disclosure,
non-disparagement clause,

583

Okay, I won't.

587
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:54,031
You will not discuss
anything you did at Hooli

588
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:57,368
at all, in perpetuity,

589
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:58,485

590
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,288

Good. You're getting the
hang of it already.

592
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,709
So, can I keep my Hooli ID, though,

593
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,879
so I can still come and hang out
with my friends on the roof?

594
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:10,547
You cannot.

595
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,300
Officially, you will no
longer have any friends here.

596
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:14,418
Shoot.

597
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,172
I have to think about this then.

598
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:21,425
This settlement offer is quite generous.

599
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,262
I know, I know. I mean, $2
million is a lot of money.

600
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,682
Two? No. It's...

601
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,935
It's $20 million.

602
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,856
Twenty?

603
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:43,080
So they fired me before they hired you,

604
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,365
so it's not your fault. I just...

605
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:48,452
I feel like this... can't really work.

606
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:50,003
- Do you understand?
- I do, Richard.

607
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:51,338
It's like...

608
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:54,425
can I really be expected
to do my best work

609
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,211
when I am constantly feeling undervalued

610
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:59,296
at the company that I started?

611
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:00,431
Does that make sense?

612
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:02,683
It does, Richard. Absolutely.
